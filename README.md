# Catch-21
Website: https://tdc0471.github.io/Catch-21/ (Will add lots of stuff)

# Windows :
To Install press WINDOWKEY+R and paste %appdata%/.minecraft in there and then go to the verisons folder and move the Catch-21 file there.

Now just open your minecraft launcher, press Installations, New... and Pick Catch-21 in the Version spot. 

Now you can use TDC's Catch-21 Minecraft Hacked Client!

# Mac :
(If this is wrong I will update)

First go to `C:\Users\<Your Username>\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\versions` in your file explorer

Put the Catch-21 file in there

Now just open your minecraft launcher, press Installations, New... and Pick Catch-21 in the Version spot. 

Now you can use TDC's Catch-21 Minecraft Hacked Client!
